# IS THIS THE CRATE I AM SEARCHING FOR
Note that Holtek has 2 chip naming regulations, one with 4 digits, the other with 5.
Crates that are generated for 4 digits ones have a naming scheme like HT32F1yyy,
the ones for 5 digits HT32F1xxxx. You should make sure this is the crate you are
searching for.

# ht32f1yyy
This crate provides an autogenerated API for access to HT32F1YYY peripherals.
The API is generated using [svd2rust] with patched svd files containing
extensive type-safe support. For more information please see the [main repo].

Refer to the [documentation] for full details.

[svd2rust]: https://github.com/japaric/svd2rust
[main repo]: https://github.com/ht32-rs/ht32-rs
[documentation]: https://docs.rs/ht32f1yyy/latest/ht32f1yyy/

## Usage
Each device supported by this crate is behind a feature gate so that you only
compile the device(s) you want. To use, in your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies.ht32f1yyy]
version = "0.2.0"
features = ["ht32f125x", "rt"]
```

The `rt` feature is optional and brings in support for `cortex-m-rt`.

In your code:

```rust
use ht32f1yyy::ht32f125x;

let mut peripherals = ht32f125x::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
let gpioa = &peripherals.GPIOA;
gpioa.odr.modify(|_, w| w.odr0().set_bit());
```

For full details on the autogenerated API, please see:
